DRAW 2 (which stands for **D**etect and **R**ecognize **A** **W**ide range of cards version 2) is an object detector
trained to detect _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ cards in all types of images, and in particular in dueling images.

This project is the plugin part of the DRAW 2 system. It allows users to seamlessly integrate the
detector directly into their live streams or recorded videos; and those **without any particular technical skills**.
The plugin can display detected cards in real time for an enhanced viewing experience.
The python backend project is available [here](https://github.com/HichTala/draw2).

### 🛠️ Installation

Follow the installation instruction depending on your operating system so everything works smoothly:

<details open>
<summary>🪟 Windows</summary>

1. Download the plugin installer from this
   link: [DRAW2 Plugin Installer](https://github.com/HichTala/draw2-plugin/releases/download/0.2.1/draw2-plugin-installer.exe)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, launch OBS Studio. If everything is set up correctly, you should see in the
   `Docks` menu
   a new option called `Draw 2`. You can activate the dock and dock it wherever you want.

   The download is complete, you can enjoy detecting !

<details>
<summary>🐧 Linux</summary>

Coming soon 👀

</details>

<details>
<summary>🍏 MacOS</summary>

I'm not familiar enough with OBS on macOS to provide a reliable installation guide.
The plugin is able to compile successfully on macOS, but I haven't tested it thoroughly.
If you have experience with OBS plugins on macOS and would like to contribute an installation guide,
please feel free to submit a pull request.

#### Building from source (Apple Silicon / macOS 26+)

There is no pre-built macOS release yet, so you have to build the plugin yourself.

1. Install the build prerequisites with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

   ```bash
   brew install cmake ccache coreutils jq xcbeautify
   ```

   You also need a recent **Xcode** (with its command line tools) and a **Python 3**
   install (`brew install python`).

2. Configure and build. On Apple Silicon, build for the host architecture only —
   the universal preset would also build an `x86_64` slice, which fails to link
   because Homebrew's Python is `arm64`-only:

   ```bash
   cmake --preset macos -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64
   cmake --build build_macos --config RelWithDebInfo
   ```

   On an Intel Mac, use `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64` instead.

3. The built plugin bundle is produced at:

   ```
   build_macos/RelWithDebInfo/draw2-plugin.plugin
   ```

4. Install it by copying the bundle into your OBS plugins folder, then restart OBS:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins"
   cp -R build_macos/RelWithDebInfo/draw2-plugin.plugin \
     "$HOME/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins/"
   ```

   Once OBS restarts, the plugin appears as `Draw 2` in the `Docks` menu.

#### Setting up the Python backend (macOS)

The plugin embeds a Python interpreter and imports the `draw` backend from a
Python installation **you** provide in the settings (`Select Python installation`).
There is no automatic download on macOS yet, so you must set this up manually.

> ⚠️ It must be a **full Python prefix (with the standard library)**, _not_ a
> `venv`/`virtualenv`. The plugin sets `PYTHONHOME` to the folder you select; a
> venv has no stdlib there and initialization fails with
> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'`.
>
> The Python **minor version must match the one the plugin was linked against**
> (currently 3.13). Check with `otool -L .../draw2-plugin | grep -i python`.

1. Get a self-contained CPython matching that version. A relocatable build from
   [python-build-standalone](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone)
   works well and won't be broken by `brew upgrade`:

   ```bash
   # pick the install_only build for your arch (aarch64 for Apple Silicon)
   curl -fL -o python.tar.gz \
     https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/<tag>/cpython-3.13.<x>+<tag>-aarch64-apple-darwin-install_only.tar.gz
   mkdir -p ~/.draw2-runtime && tar -xzf python.tar.gz -C ~/.draw2-runtime
   ```

2. Install the `draw` backend into that prefix. Use the **`obs-plugin` branch** —
   that is the one that exposes the `draw.run(...)` entry point the plugin calls
   (the default `main` branch is the standalone CLI and has no `run`, so the dock
   will log `Failed to import draw module` / `Failed to find or call draw run function`):

   ```bash
   ~/.draw2-runtime/python/bin/python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/HichTala/draw2@obs-plugin"
   ```

3. In the Draw 2 settings, set **Select Python installation** to the prefix folder
   (the one that contains `bin/` and `lib/`), e.g. `~/.draw2-runtime/python`.
   Verify the layout expected by the plugin:

   ```text
   <prefix>/bin/python
   <prefix>/lib/python3.13/site-packages/draw
   ```

   </details>

### 🚀 Usage

When the plugin is installed and the model weights are downloaded, you can launch OBS Studio.

1. Open the `Docks` menu and select `Draw 2` to activate the plugin dock. Besides the `Start DRAW` button, the dock
   shows a log panel where the backend's progress and any errors are printed.
2. In the Draw 2 dock, you can configure the plugin settings by clicking on the gear icon next to `Start DRAW` button:
   - **Select Python installation**: Path to the Python prefix that has the `draw` backend installed (the folder
     containing `bin/` and `lib/`). Must be a full Python install, not a virtualenv. See the macOS setup section
     for details.
   - **Select Deck Lists to use**: Choose the deck list files that contain the cards you want to detect. Up to
     3 deck lists can be handled at the same time, and you can configure a separate set for **Player 1** and
     **Player 2**. To add new deck lists, you can click the `Open Folder` button and drag and drop your deck list
     files (in ydk format) into the opened folder. The folder now lives in OBS' plugin configuration directory, so
     your deck lists survive plugin updates and reinstalls.
   - **Minimum Out of Screen Time**: The minimum time a card just detected can be displayed again.
   - **Minimum Screen Time**: The minimum time a card is displayed.
   - **Confidence Threshold**: Set the minimum confidence level for card detection. Detections below this threshold
     will be ignored.
3. The plugin provide a new source called `Draw Display`. You can add it to your scene like any other source.
   This source will display the detected cards on the screen. You can choose what source/scene to detect cards from.

   This source can also fine-tune what the detector actually sees. These options are **off by default**; enable the
   ones you need from the Draw 2 settings (gear icon) under *Advanced features*, and they will then appear on the
   source's properties:
   - **Detector / Player**: which player (1 or 2) this source feeds, so you can run one detector per player at the
     same time.
   - **Crop — Left / Top / Right / Bottom**: pixels removed from each edge to focus detection on a region of the
     capture, without affecting the source elsewhere.
   - **Rotate input 180°**: rotate the captured input before sending it to the detector (useful when the camera is
     mounted upside down).
4. Click the `Start DRAW` button to start the detection process. The plugin will start detecting cards in real time
   and display them on the screen using the `Draw Display` source. The plugin start detecting from the moment you see
   the
   `Stop DRAW` button. If you don't see it something went wrong.
5. In the other case you can enjoy the plugin!
